# Spatial distributions of GOA seabirds for Atlantis GOA

This code produces spatial distribution maps of the main species of seabirds in the GOA, based on two main data sources:  

1. The [FWS Beringian Seabird 2004](https://seamap.env.duke.edu/dataset/270) for the summer distributions of species that nest in the GOA.
2. The [North Pacific Pelagic Seabird Database](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/alaska-science-center/science/north-pacific-pelagic-seabird-database?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects) for winter distributions and summer distributions of non-nesting species with sdmTMB.  

See code for details. The mapping effort was restricted to GOA seabird species identified in: *Guénette, Sylvie., 2005. Models of Southeast Alaska. In: Guénette, S., and V. Christensen (editors). 2005. Food web models and data for studying fisheries and environmental impacts on Eastern Pacific ecosystems Fisheries Centre Research Reports 13(1):106-178.*
